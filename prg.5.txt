5. write a program to demonstrate mutability and immutability of python strings,lists,and tuples



# Define a string, a list, and a tuple
string1 = "Hello, world!"
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
tuple1 = (6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

# Demonstrate the immutability of strings
print("Original string:", string1)
# Attempt to modify the string
try:
    string1[0] = "h"
except TypeError:
    print("Strings are immutable!")
# String remains unchanged
print("String after attempted modification:", string1)

# Demonstrate the mutability of lists
print("Original list:", list1)
# Modify the list
list1[0] = 0
print("List after modification:", list1)

# Demonstrate the immutability of tuples
print("Original tuple:", tuple1)
# Attempt to modify the tuple
try:
    tuple1[0] = 5
except TypeError:
    print("Tuples are immutable!")
# Tuple remains unchanged
print("Tuple after attempted modification:", tuple1)
