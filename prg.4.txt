4. write a  iterative  and an recursive program to produce fibonacci series for given number



# Define a function to generate the Fibonacci series using iteration
def fib_iterative(n):
    # Define the first two numbers of the series
    a, b = 0, 1
    
    # Create a list to store the series
    fib_series = []
    
    # Loop through the series up to the given number and append each number to the list
    for i in range(n):
        fib_series.append(a)
        a, b = b, a+b
        
    return fib_series

# Ask the user to enter a number
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Generate the Fibonacci series using iteration and print the result
fib_series = fib_iterative(n)
print("Fibonacci series (iterative):", fib_series)




# Define a function to generate the Fibonacci series using recursion
def fib_recursive(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib_recursive(n-1) + fib_recursive(n-2)

# Ask the user to enter a number
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Generate the Fibonacci series using recursion and print the result
fib_series = []
for i in range(n):
    fib_series.append(fib_recursive(i))
print("Fibonacci series (recursive):", fib_series)
