1. write a program to accept defined inputs and the perform the basics arithmetic operations




# Accepting user input
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Performing arithmetic operations
addition = num1 + num2
subtraction = num1 - num2
multiplication = num1 * num2
division = num1 / num2

# Displaying the results
print("The sum of {} and {} is {}".format(num1, num2, addition))
print("The difference between {} and {} is {}".format(num1, num2, subtraction))
print("The product of {} and {} is {}".format(num1, num2, multiplication))
print("The quotient of {} and {} is {}".format(num1, num2, division))
