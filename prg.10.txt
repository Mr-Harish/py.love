10. write a program to perform following operations : create a cvs file ,insert values,operate on multiple columns,update and delete values



import csv

# Create a CSV file and insert some values
with open('example.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['Name', 'Age', 'Salary'])
    writer.writerow(['Alice', '25', '50000'])
    writer.writerow(['Bob', '30', '60000'])
    writer.writerow(['Charlie', '35', '70000'])

# Open the CSV file and perform some operations
with open('example.csv', mode='r', newline='') as file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    for row in reader:
        # Print out the values for each row
        print(f"Name: {row['Name']}, Age: {row['Age']}, Salary: {row['Salary']}")

    # Operate on multiple columns
    for row in reader:
        # Calculate and print out the total compensation for each employee
        salary = int(row['Salary'])
        bonus = 0.1 * salary
        total_compensation = salary + bonus
        print(f"Name: {row['Name']}, Total Compensation: {total_compensation}")

# Update a value in the CSV file
with open('example.csv', mode='r+', newline='') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    for row in reader:
        if row[0] == 'Bob':
            # Update Bob's salary to 65000
            row[2] = '65000'
        writer.writerow(row)

# Delete a row from the CSV file
with open('example.csv', mode='r+', newline='') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    rows = [row for row in reader if row[0] != 'Charlie']
    file.seek(0)
    writer.writerows(rows)
    file.truncate()
