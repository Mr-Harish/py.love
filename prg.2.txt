2. write a program to display the sum of all the even numbers between a user  inputted range. implement using for and while loop


# Ask the user to enter the range
start = int(input("Enter the starting number: "))
end = int(input("Enter the ending number: "))

# Calculate the sum of even numbers using a for loop
sum_even = 0
for i in range(start, end+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        sum_even += i

# Print the sum of even numbers
print("The sum of even numbers between", start, "and", end, "is", sum_even)


# Ask the user to enter the range
start = int(input("Enter the starting number: "))
end = int(input("Enter the ending number: "))

# Calculate the sum of even numbers using a while loop
sum_even = 0
i = start
while i <= end:
    if i % 2 == 0:
        sum_even += i
    i += 1

# Print the sum of even numbers
print("The sum of even numbers between", start, "and", end, "is", sum_even)
