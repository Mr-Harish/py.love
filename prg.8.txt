8. write a program to demonstrate constructor and destructor



class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        print(f"{self.name} has been created.")

    def say_hello(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name}.")

    def __del__(self):
        print(f"{self.name} has been deleted.")


# Create a new Person object
person1 = Person("Alice")

# Call a method on the Person object
person1.say_hello()

# Delete the Person object
del person1

# Try to call a method on the deleted Person object (will result in an error)
# person1.say_hello()
